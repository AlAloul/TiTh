# TiTh

Allows you to switch Alloy themes from the command line

## Why?

Working with multiple themes apps, I found this a quick way to switch between them.

## Install [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/tith.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/tith)

As global CLI:

    $ npm install -g tith

## Usage

##Default

This will show the current theme name:

    $ tith    

##Switch themes (Alloy)

$ tich select <name>

You'll need to do a:

    $ ti clean
    
too before building with Titanium
